# Demonstrators for Client-Side Web Development Mistakes

This repository demonstrates several **client-side web development mistakes**.
In addition, explanations of the mistakes and mitigations are provided for all of these mistakes.

This repository is based on the [cryptography-specific demonstrators](https://github.com/wichmannpas/webcrypto-mistakes-demonstrators) that I designed for [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3538969.3538977) (P. Wichmann, M. Blochberger, H. Federrath: For Better or Worse? Analyzing Use and Possible Misuse of the Web Cryptography API).

The script `./serve.py` starts a simple local webserver (by default on port 8000).
